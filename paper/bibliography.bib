abstract={Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

abstract={Detection of malicious software at the hardware level is emerging as an effective solution to increasing security threats. Hardware based detectors rely on Machine Learning(ML) classifiers to detect malware-like execution pattern based on Hardware Performance Counters(HPC) information at run-time. The effectiveness of these learning methods mainly relies on the information provided by expensive-to-implement limited number of HPC. This paper is the first attempt to thoroughly analyze various robust machine learning methods to classify benign and malware applications. Given the limited availability of HPC the analysis results help guiding architectural decision on what hardware performance counters are needed most to effectively improve ML classification accuracy. For software implementation we fully implemented these classifier at OS Kernel to understand various software overheads. The software implementation of these classifiers are found to be relatively slow with the execution time in the range of milliseconds, order of magnitude higher than the latency needed to capture malware at run-time. This is calling for hardware accelerated implementation of these algorithms. For hardware implementation, we have synthesized the studied classifier models on FPGA to compare various design parameters including logic area, power, and latency. The results show that while complex ML classifier such as MultiLayerPerceptron and logistics are achieving close to 90\% accuracy, after taking into consideration their implementation overheads, they perform worst in terms of PDP, accuracy/area and latency compared to simpler but slightly less accurate rule based and tree based classifiers. Our results further show OneR to be the most cost-effective classifier with more than 80\% accuracy and fast execution time of less than 10ns, achieving highest accuracy per logic area, while mainly relying on only a single branch-instruction HPC information.},

abstract={With the recent boom in the cryptocurrency market, hackers have been on the lookout to find novel ways of commandeering users' machine for covert and stealthy mining operations. In an attempt to expose such under-the-hood practices, this paper explores the issue of browser cryptojacking, whereby miners are secretly deployed inside browser code without the knowledge of the user. To this end, we analyze the top 50k websites from Alexa and find a noticeable percentage of sites that are indulging in this exploitative exercise often using heavily obfuscated code. Furthermore, mining prevention plug-ins, such as NoMiner, fail to flag such cleverly concealed instances. Hence, we propose a machine learning solution based on hardware-assisted profiling of browser code in real-time. A fine-grained micro-architectural footprint allows us to classify mining applications with >99\% accuracy and even flags them if the mining code has been heavily obfuscated or encrypted. We build our own browser extension and show that it outperforms other plug-ins. The proposed design has negligible overhead on the user's machine and works for all standard off-the-shelf CPUs.},

ABSTRACT = {The extensive proliferation of modern information services and ubiquitous digitization of society have raised cybersecurity challenges to new levels. With the massive number of connected devices, opportunities for potential network attacks are nearly unlimited. An additional problem is that many low-cost devices are not equipped with effective security protection so that they are easily hacked and applied within a network of bots (botnet) to perform distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) based on deep learning that aims to identify suspicious behavior in modern heterogeneous information systems. The proposed approach is based on a deep recurrent autoencoder that learns time series of normal network behavior and detects notable network anomalies. An additional feature of the proposed IDS is that it is trained with an optimized dataset, where the number of features is reduced by 94\% without classification accuracy loss. Thus, the proposed IDS remains stable in response to slight system perturbations, which do not represent network anomalies. The proposed approach is evaluated under different simulation scenarios and provides a 99\% detection accuracy over known datasets while reducing the training time by an order of magnitude.},
