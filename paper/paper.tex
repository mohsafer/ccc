\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
...
In this paper we present a framework for training and evaluating models that detects malware in operating systems based on performance counters.

\cite{xAPI2019}

In Figure \ref{fig:approach} we present conceptually our approach.

We start our approach at a Virtual Machine (VM) running viruses from VirusTotal.
On the same VM we run a tool that collects the performance counters into several time series.
Next, the results are normalized using statistical operators like Min-Max and Z-Score.
On the resulted time series we trained several classification models:
i) ResNet;
ii) CNN;
iii) t-LeNet;
iv) FCN;
v) MLP;
vi) Encoder;
vii) MCNN;
viii) MCDCNN;
ix) Time CNN;
x) Inception Time.
On the trained classification models accuracy tests were performed and corresponding graphs were plotted.

We consider that the trained classfiers could be used on a real machine as a malware detection tool.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions-and-future-work}
In this paper we presented an experimental setup where performance counters time series were extracted from a malware infected virtual machine.
The performance counter time series were normalized and were used to train 10 classification models.

As future work we intend to experiment with the 10 classifiers detecting malware and assessing their performance.
